# Experimenting with generative art

Here I try and create a set of simple rules for which interact to (hopefully) create interesting emergent patterns.

These posts will be heavily inspired by the work of Anders Hoff, which has done some really interesting things in this area. Besides sharing is work and the [code he uses to generate them](https://github.com/inconvergent), he also writes about his process and how he creates what he does on [his website](https://inconvergent.net).

## Usage

Although you're free to use anything shared here, beware that this won't be very well maintained. I hope to eventually write a library (which will be maintained) for creating stuff like this, but that's still a ways off.

Using pycairo+gtk3 requires a lot of dependencies outside of python, so I've provided a conda `environment.yml` file. Check [this](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#sharing-an-environment) out for how to use it.

I'm running Ubuntu 18.04, so your mileage on other systems may vary.
